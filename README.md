# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on certain health parameters. The model is built using machine learning (SVM classifier), and the user interface is developed using **Streamlit**, **HTML**, and **CSS** to make it interactive and user-friendly.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on data features like age, BMI, blood pressure, insulin levels, etc. The prediction is made using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model, which is trained on a diabetes dataset. The frontend interface is built using **Streamlit**, **HTML**, and **CSS** to allow users to input their health data and receive the prediction in real-time.
